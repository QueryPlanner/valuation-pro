"Thus, if you are valuing a technology firm that is 6 years old, the chance of failure is 11.70%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Factors to consider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. The likelihood of failure decreases for larger firms. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. The likelihood of failure decreases with access to capital, and is thus lower for publicly traded firms or firms with multiple high profile VCs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. The likelihood of failure decreases as revenue growth increases, since hope for future growth will sustain the firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. The likelihood of failure decreases with better unit economics, higher gross margins on the additional units sold",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
