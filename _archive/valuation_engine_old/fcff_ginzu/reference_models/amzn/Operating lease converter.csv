Operating Lease Converter,,,,,,,
The yellow cells are input cells. Please enter them.,,,,,,,
Inputs,,,,,,,"Until 2019, this worksheet had to be used for every firm with operating lease commitments, since accountants treated operating lease expenses as operating expenses. In 2019, IFRS and GAAP made the long-overdue change to treat leases as debt, and for firms that follow these standards, the conversion that I am doing on this spreadsheet is being done by accountants, with lease debt and operating income already adjusted. If that is the case, and you showed the lease debt as part of debt in the input page, please do not use this spreadsheet, since you will be double counting."
